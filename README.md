## Running the Notebooks in the Cloud
- _Recommended:_ You can clone this repository on Azure Notebooks and keep the history: __[Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/marcolussetti/libraries/python4data2017)__
    - Use 'Clone' to create your own copy of the repository
- You can use Binder to spin up a temporary temporary instance with the notebooks: [![Binder](https://beta.mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/marcolussetti/python4data2017/master)
    - It will take you to a free hosted service that lets you experiment. Please note that any changes won't be saved to this repository or your computer.
    - If you want to save your results, when you are inside a notebook, use the menus: File -> Download as -> Notebook.

## Running the Notebooks on local machine
If you wish to run the notebooks locally, I would suggest just installing a scientific python distribution like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which comes with Jupyter Notebooks and a bunch more goodies built in.
